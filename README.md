- **Compare Flexbox to Grid:** The challenge presented an opportunity to contrast Flexbox with its counterpart, Grid. This comparative analysis helped me understand the strengths and weaknesses of each layout system, equipping me to choose the right tool for the job in future projects.
- **Master CSS functions:** Specifically, I focused on the clamp() function, learning how to manipulate its parameters to achieve precise and responsive design elements.
- **Handle pseudo-classes and elements:** The project provided a platform to experiment with pseudo-classes and elements, improving my ability to control the appearance and behavior of specific elements based on context and user interaction.

Overall, this project pushed me to actively research and implement new techniques. It wasn't just about completing a task but also about expanding my skillset and learning valuable lessons along the way.
